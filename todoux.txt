UX – Top 5

1) [done] Keep header/time sticky on scroll 

so the day names and time column stay visible while you scroll the grid. 
Right now both scroll away in WeekGrid.tsx.

2) [done] Clarify state on hover/focus 

by showing a small tooltip/status label (e.g., “Thu 1, 11:30 – calendar blocked”) 
on the cells in WeekGrid.tsx; helps since we now rely on two colors and tiny icons.

3) Add keyboard/focus support 

for slot/day buttons: focus rings and aria-labels on the table buttons in 
WeekGrid.tsx and the nav buttons in WeekNavigator.tsx.

4) [done] Show in-progress feedback on toggles 

(spinner/disabled state while awaiting Firestore update) in AdminSlots.tsx 
and WeekGrid.tsx; right now taps feel instant even if the request is pending.

5) [done] Surface quick day summaries 

(e.g., “Thu: 3 booked, 2 blocked, 10 available”) in hover tooltips on day headers in WeekGrid.tsx 
so admins can scan availability without scrolling.
