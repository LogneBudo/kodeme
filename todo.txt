Architecture – Top 5

1) Extract inline styles to a shared theme: 

DONE: moved the large style objects in AdminSlots.tsx, WeekNavigator.tsx, and WeekGrid.tsx
into CSS modules for consistency. Consider adding shared spacing/typography tokens next.

2) Centralize slot/time helpers: 

the slot generation and status logic in WeekGrid.tsx and the day toggle logic in
AdminSlots.tsx should live in a shared utility/hook 
(e.g., useWeekSlots(settings, appointments, events)) to keep UI components lean.

3) Add robust error handling for data fetches: 

getSettings, listAppointments, and getCalendarEventsForWeek in AdminSlots.tsx run 
without try/catch; surface toast errors and fallbacks so the grid doesn’t silently fail.

4) Avoid direct DOM mutation for layout:

instead of setting document.body.style.overflow in AdminSlots.tsx, manage scroll 
locking via a layout provider or a reusable hook (so other pages don’t fight over 
*body styles).

5) Formalize state/status types: 

define enums/constants for slot states and colors and reuse them across WeekGrid.tsx 
and related components, reducing string comparisons and making future visual changes 
a one-liner.
