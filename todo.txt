Architecture – Top 5

1) Extract inline styles to a shared theme: 

DONE: moved the large style objects in AdminSlots.tsx, WeekNavigator.tsx, and WeekGrid.tsx
into CSS modules for consistency. Consider adding shared spacing/typography tokens next.

2) Centralize slot/time helpers: 

DONE: slot generation, status lookup, and day/slot toggle logic now live in
useWeekSlots, shared by AdminSlots and WeekGrid to keep UI components lean.

3) Add robust error handling for data fetches: 

DONE: AdminSlots now wraps settings fetch and weekly appointments/calendar fetches in
try/catch with toast errors, fallbacks, and mounted guards so the grid won’t silently fail.

4) Avoid direct DOM mutation for layout:

DONE: Added useScrollLock hook and wired AdminSlots to avoid direct body mutation.

5) Formalize state/status types: 

DONE: Added SlotState constants + display/class maps reused by useWeekSlots and
WeekGrid for labels/icons/colors, so status tweaks are now single-source.
